### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After nearly 10 years at [Yele Consulting](https://www.yele.fr/), a consulting firm specializing in supporting the environmental and digital transformation of energy sector, I left my position as Senior Manager and Director of Information Systems.

I joined [42 School](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) to enhance my skills in software development. I was among the fastest in my cohort to complete the core curriculum at 42, which allowed me time to develop my skills in AI and machine learning.

Today, I am seeking to consolidate my new technical skills and explore how emerging technologies such as AI can transform various industrial sectors.
